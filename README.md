## What is hercules challenge?
The [HERCULES project](https://www.um.es/web/hercules/) has been proposed as a University Research Data Semantics system for Spanish universities with the goal of developing new semantic  web technologies that gather new  information and integrate multiple nodes with heterogeneous ontologies and vocabularies. The University of Murcia (hereinafter UM) signed an agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MINECO) in 2017 backing the HERCULES project with an 80% of cofinancing from the European Regional Development Fund program (ERDF) within the 2014-2020 period. The purpose of this agreement was to establish collaboration amongst MINECO and the UM,  directed towards the improvement of public services and business innovation through the Public Procurement of Innovation. Some goals of the system were to create a research management system with semantic capabilities and infrastructures and create support systems for the detection of synergies in R&D between universities. The HERCULES project was divided in three main sub-projects: semantic architecture and ontological  infrastructure, research management system; and data enrichment and methods of analysis.

The Herculles challenge is a part of EDMA, which belongs to the data enrichment and methods of analysis sub-project. The main objective of the Hercules Challenge is the extraction of topics that describe a Research Object (RO), and the use of those topics to generate a researcher profile based on their RO production. The challenge is divided into 3 main tracks related to three different kinds of research objects: Publications, Experimental Protocols and Git Repositories. Results obtained for each track must be expressed using a common model based on Linked Open Data.

## Directory structure
This repository is structured as follows:
